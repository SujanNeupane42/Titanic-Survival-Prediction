This is a simple classification project. I have used following python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

I have used the following Models:
  1. KNeighborsClassifier
  2. LogisticRegression
  3. MultinomialNB
  4. XGBClassifier
  5. DescisonTreeClassifier
  6. RandomForestClassifier

Furthermore, I have performed Hyperparameter tuning for these models as well to optimize the performance of these models on validation and testing set.

## Dataset
I have not included the dataset in the repository. However, you could find the official dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)


In this classification project,  we will use different features like passenger class, sex, age, fare, etc to predict whether a person will survive in titanic or not.
